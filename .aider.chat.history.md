**Defining the Scope**

I've clarified the user's request. It's a system administration issue, not a coding problem. Therefore, I'll focus on providing upgrade instructions for Go and avoid suggesting code modifications or requesting files. The core task is now well-defined.


**Prioritizing the Answer**

I've focused on the most direct approach. My goal is to deliver a clear, concise guide to the user. I will provide the essential steps for upgrading the Go installation, starting with downloading the latest binary. The plan is to cover the removal of the old version, extracting the new archive, and finally, verifying the path.

It looks like you're asking for instructions on how to upgrade your Go installation, which is a system-level change rather than a change to the code in your repository.

To upgrade Go to the latest version, you would typically follow these general steps:

1.  **Download the latest Go version:** Go to the official Go downloads page (golang.org/dl/) and download the appropriate archive for your operating system (Linux x86-64 in your case).
2.  **Remove the old installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ```
3.  **Install the new version:** Extract the archive you downloaded into `/usr/local`. If you downloaded `go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz` (replace `1.XX.Y` with the actual version), you would run:
    ```bash
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
4.  **Update your PATH (if necessary):** Ensure that `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable. You might need to update your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) by adding or modifying a line like:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    Then, source the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or open a new terminal.

After these steps, you can verify the new installation:
```bash
go version
```

Please note that these are general instructions. You should always refer to the official Go installation documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Since this isn't a code change request for your project, I won't suggest any file edits.
