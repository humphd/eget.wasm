<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Defining the Scope**

I've clarified the user's request. It's a system administration issue, not a coding problem. Therefore, I'll focus on providing upgrade instructions for Go and avoid suggesting code modifications or requesting files. The core task is now well-defined.


**Prioritizing the Answer**

I've focused on the most direct approach. My goal is to deliver a clear, concise guide to the user. I will provide the essential steps for upgrading the Go installation, starting with downloading the latest binary. The plan is to cover the removal of the old version, extracting the new archive, and finally, verifying the path.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

It looks like you're asking for instructions on how to upgrade your Go installation, which is a system-level change rather than a change to the code in your repository.

To upgrade Go to the latest version, you would typically follow these general steps:

1.  **Download the latest Go version:** Go to the official Go downloads page (golang.org/dl/) and download the appropriate archive for your operating system (Linux x86-64 in your case).
2.  **Remove the old installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ```
3.  **Install the new version:** Extract the archive you downloaded into `/usr/local`. If you downloaded `go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz` (replace `1.XX.Y` with the actual version), you would run:
    ```bash
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
4.  **Update your PATH (if necessary):** Ensure that `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable. You might need to update your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) by adding or modifying a line like:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    Then, source the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or open a new terminal.

After these steps, you can verify the new installation:
```bash
go version
```

Please note that these are general instructions. You should always refer to the official Go installation documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Since this isn't a code change request for your project, I won't suggest any file edits.

#### GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build builds a huge binary, what  flags to use to optimize for footprint  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Examining Build Optimization**

I'm currently analyzing the user's request for optimized Go build flags for WebAssembly compilation (GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm). I am focusing on providing the most concise and effective `go build` command, specifically targeting reduced binary size, without changing any Go source code. I will present the solution in a `bash` block, as requested.


**Crafting the Build Command**

I've finalized the `go build` command, integrating the essential flags for size optimization. The command will include `-ldflags="-s -w"` for stripping debug information and symbol tables, along with `-trimpath` to further reduce the binary footprint. I will now verify the command's syntax to make sure it works as expected.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

To optimize for a smaller binary footprint when building for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm`, you can use the `-ldflags` option with `-s` and `-w`. The `-s` flag omits the symbol table and debug information, and the `-w` flag omits the DWARF symbol table. Additionally, `-trimpath` can help by removing local file system paths from the compiled binary.

Here's a suggested command:

```bash
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o yourprogram.wasm .
```
Replace `yourprogram.wasm` with your desired output file name and `.` with the path to your main package if it's not the current directory.

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Examining Conditional Compilation**

I'm currently focused on how to implement conditional compilation to avoid network calls for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds. The strategy is to redirect network requests to file system reads from `/tmp` and `/url`. I've started sketching out the build tag implementation to differentiate the `wasip1` build.


**Defining Filesystem Reads**

I've started examining the `dl.go` file to identify network-related functions. Specifically, I need to replace `Get`, `SetAuthHeader` and functions that are dependent on these with filesystem-based alternatives. I've decided to create a `dl_wasip1.go` with a build tag for the `wasip1` target to implement these file system alternatives.


**Planning Filesystem Mappings**

My current focus is on how to map URLs to filesystem paths. For `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds, I need to transform URLs like `https://api.github.com/repos/foo/bar/releases?page=1` into filesystem paths. I think I'll replace `https://` with an empty string to create the filepath. Now I am exploring how to handle any existing query parameters in a clean way.


**Designing URL to Path Mapping**

I'm currently evaluating the most practical method for translating URLs into filesystem paths. Replacing "https://" with "" simplifies the path structure, but the remaining slashes pose a challenge. The `/tmp/url` directory suggested by the user is guiding my implementation.


**Mapping URL and Files**

I'm now focusing on the `Get` function, and how to implement the filesystem read within it. The primary goal is to transform the URL into a usable file path under `/tmp`. My plan is to replace "https://" with an empty string and use the `path.Join` function to build a path. I'll then create a stub `Get` in `dl_wasip1.go` that handles opening the file, returning a plausible `http.Response` with the file content.


**Refactoring GetRateLimit**

I've been making progress on replacing the `GetRateLimit` function. I've decided to read from a file in `/tmp`, and unmarshal the JSON content directly to satisfy the wasm build requirement. I'm also evaluating whether to modify the existing `IsLocalFile` function or create a new one to handle the URL-to-path translation.


**Evaluating Wasip1 Implementation**

I'm currently planning the implementation of `GetRateLimit` and how it interacts with the new `Get` function. The goal is to ensure that `GetRateLimit` reads the rate limit data from the file system in the wasm build. I need to determine the best way to handle the file system path for this function.


**Defining dl_nowasm.go and dl_wasip1.go**

I'm changing course and planning to use `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, with build tags. The `dl_nowasm.go` file will contain the original implementations, and will use the `//go:build !wasip1` build tag.  The `dl_wasip1.go` file will contain my wasm implementations. This avoids duplicating type definitions, and simplifies build tag management.


**Structuring the Code**

I'm now refactoring the code to use `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go`, with build tags to manage different implementations. This includes moving common type definitions to avoid duplication. This approach simplifies the conditional compilation for network operations.


**Structuring The Files**

I'm now working on separating the code into `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, as well as a `dl_common.go` for shared types, like `RateLimit`. This involves moving the common definitions and planning build tags for conditional compilation of the network and filesystem implementations.


**Restructuring and Code Splitting**

I've shifted my focus to structuring the code for the wasm implementation. My plan is to create `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, each with build tags. This is for code clarity and maintainability.


**Implementing dl_common.go**

I've decided to introduce a `dl_common.go` file to hold the shared types, namely `RateLimitJson` and `RateLimit`, and their associated methods. This refactoring will allow me to avoid duplicating these definitions in both the `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files.


**Implementing Shared Definitions**

I'm now focused on building the `dl_common.go` file and defining the `RateLimitJson`, and `RateLimit` structs within it. These structs will be shared, eliminating any redundancy in the other two files. This approach also means I will keep using the `Download` function from the non-wasm implementation.


**Splitting the Files**

I'm now focused on creating and organizing the necessary files for the wasm build. My plan is to split the code into three files: `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. This separation will help with conditional compilation and code clarity by separating http and wasm implementations.


**Refactoring File Structure**

I'm now restructuring the code with three files: `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. The common types will live in `dl_common.go` to avoid duplication. I'll place `dl.go` in the original location and add the appropriate build tags.


**Creating Build Tag Structure**

I'm now refactoring the files and plan to create `dl_http.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. This is for clarity and to separate the http and wasm implementations. The `dl_common.go` file will house shared definitions to avoid duplication across the other two files.


**Defining File Splits**

I'm now planning the required file structure with `dl.go` handling HTTP, and `dl_wasip1.go` providing the wasm implementation, and `dl_common.go` for shared data structures. This approach will address the need to avoid network calls during wasm compilation.


**Adapting for wasm Build**

I've recently decided to introduce `dl_nowasm.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go` files to restructure the codebase for better clarity. This design will allow me to keep the current network calls while separately implementing the filesystem reads for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds.


**Refining the File Split**

I'm now making the final modifications to the `dl_wasip1.go` file, including a more robust URL-to-path conversion within the `urlToPath` function to handle both `http` and `https` prefixes. Also, I'm confirming that both files have all necessary function definitions and that the `Download` function will seamlessly integrate the filesystem reads.


**Creating wasm implementation**

I'm now focused on creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file, which will contain all of the wasm-specific logic. This file will include the same exported functions as `dl.go` but with implementations that use the filesystem.


**Adapting to wasm Implementation**

I'm wrapping up the creation of the `dl_wasip1.go` file, concentrating on how to handle the `urlToPath` function, which has undergone a refinement for both `http` and `https` URL prefixes. Also, I'm currently verifying that all the required function definitions are correctly implemented within the `dl_wasip1.go` file and that the `Download` function can integrate these file system read operations as needed.


**Finalizing Wasm Implementation**

I'm now putting the finishing touches on the `dl_wasip1.go` file. This involves refining the `urlToPath` function, which now handles both `http` and `https` prefixes. I'm also verifying that the wasm implementation for `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and other methods are correctly implemented and the `Download` function correctly utilizes the filesystem implementation.


**Adapting for Filesystem Reads**

I'm currently working on implementing the `dl_wasip1.go` file, containing all of the wasm-specific logic. The main focus is on correctly mapping the URLs, including both `http` and `https` prefixes, to paths that can be read from the filesystem, using a newly defined `urlToPath` function.


**Creating wasm Implementations**

I'm currently adding the `//go:build !wasip1` build tag to `dl.go` and then creating `dl_wasip1.go`. This will separate the network and filesystem implementations. I'm still assessing the most effective approach to handle the common functions and structs, like `Download` and `RateLimitJson`.


**Adapting to Wasm Implementation**

I'm starting to focus on the main file's content for wasm builds. I'll be adding `dl_wasip1.go` and `dl_common.go` files, creating a clear separation of concerns. The goal is to adapt the implementation to use filesystem operations, while maintaining the original `dl.go` file.


**Implementing Wasm Build**

I'm now focusing on the most efficient way to handle the wasm implementation, given the constraint to avoid any network calls. The plan involves adding `//go:build !wasip1` to `dl.go` and creating `dl_wasip1.go` with `//go:build wasip1` to implement the filesystem-based alternatives, including the `urlToPath` function.


**Implementing wasm build tags**

I'm now completing the code splitting, adding the `//go:build !wasip1` tag to the original file and creating a new `dl_wasip1.go` to contain the wasm implementation. This approach should keep the original implementation untouched while ensuring the wasm build utilizes filesystem operations.


**Refactoring for Build Tags**

I'm currently planning to restructure the code using the `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and potentially a `dl_common.go`. The primary focus is now on separating the HTTP and wasm implementations using build tags, with `dl_common.go` to contain common types. I'm also considering whether I need to refactor the `Download` function.


**Implementing wasm build**

I'm now creating `dl_wasip1.go` for wasm-specific functions, as I planned. This file will contain all the same public functions as the original `dl.go`, but it will use filesystem reads instead of network calls for  `Get`, `GetRateLimit` and `Download`.


**Implementing wasm build**

I'm now implementing the wasm build by adding `//go:build !wasip1` to the original `dl.go` file, and by creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file to contain the filesystem-based implementations of `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and `Download`. This ensures that the wasm build targets use file system reads to avoid network calls.


**Implementing wasm builds**

I'm now implementing the wasm build by adding `//go:build !wasip1` to the original `dl.go` file, and by creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file to contain the filesystem-based implementations of `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and `Download`. This ensures that the wasm build targets use file system reads to avoid network calls.


**Implementing wasip1 builds**

I'm now submitting the required updates. I'll add the build tag `//go:build !wasip1` to the `dl.go` file, making it exclusive to non-wasm builds. Then, I'll create a new file, `dl_wasip1.go`, containing the `wasip1` build with filesystem-based implementations for `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and related functions, to satisfy the user's need.


**Finalizing Build Implementation**

I've now completed the file adaptations by adding the build tag `//go:build !wasip1` to `dl.go`, ensuring that the file excludes the wasip1 builds. Also, I've created `dl_wasip1.go`, which contains the filesystem-based functions, including `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and the necessary helper functions and data structures.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. To avoid network calls when compiling for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm`, I will use build tags to provide an alternative implementation of the functions in `dl.go`.

Here is my plan:
1.  I will add a `//go:build !wasip1` build tag to `dl.go`. This will exclude the file from compilation when targeting `wasip1`.
2.  I will create a new file, `dl_wasip1.go`, with a `//go:build wasip1` build tag. This file will provide implementations for the functions in `dl.go` that read from the filesystem instead of making network calls, as you requested. For a given URL, it will attempt to read from `/tmp/` plus the URL's path.

**Crafting a Build Script**

I'm now focused on implementing the user's request. The plan is straightforward: I need to generate a new file, specifically `build-wasi.sh`. Inside this file, the script will execute the `go build` command, targeting the WASI platform. I'm paying attention to setting the correct environment variables for the target platform as well. The build is being optimized to reduce the final binary size.


**Defining the Shell Script**

I've finalized the contents of `build-wasi.sh`.  I'm confident that the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables are correctly set. The `-ldflags` and `-trimpath` flags are also set appropriately for optimal binary size. I'm preparing the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block for the new file, including `#!/bin/sh` for proper execution. The script should be fully functional now. I will next implement the shell command.


**Finalizing File and Command**

I've refined the script, and now I am ready to move onto the final steps. I'm using a `SEARCH/REPLACE` block, and I'm including the necessary `#!/bin/sh` shebang. The provided shell command to execute will address the executability of the file, as requested. I will also provide an explanation to make my intentions clear.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. I will create the `build-wasi.sh` script as you requested.

Here is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block to create the file:

```sh
build-wasi.sh
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
#!/bin/sh
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And here is the command to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x build-wasi.sh
```

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Examining OS Targets**

I'm currently examining `detect.go` to identify the supported operating systems, as requested. The `OS` struct and associated regular expressions appear key to identifying the target OS. I am also considering the `anti` field, but I will look into its use in more detail.


**Identifying OS Support**

I've moved on from just looking at the `OS` struct. The function `NewSystemDetector` hints that `goosmap` holds the supported OSes. I need to inspect the file contents to see how `goosmap` is defined and populated. I've requested the user provide the `detect.go` file to proceed.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Based on the file summaries, I can see a `NewSystemDetector` function in `detect.go` which seems to validate the target OS against a map called `goosmap`. To list the supported operating systems, I need to see the contents of that map.

Please add `detect.go` to the chat.

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Listing Supported Systems**

I've examined the `detect.go` file and found the `goosmap` variable. My task is to extract the operating system keys from this map. I'll need to enumerate those keys to provide the user with the supported OS list.


**Analyzing OS Keys**

I've parsed the `goosmap` variable in `detect.go` and identified the relevant keys. I will now construct a list of supported operating systems using these keys, namely: "darwin", "windows", "linux", "netbsd", "openbsd", "freebsd", "android", "illumos", "solaris", and "plan9". The response will be in English, and the information presented should be concise.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Based on the `goosmap` variable in `detect.go`, the supported target operating systems are:

*   darwin
*   windows
*   linux
*   netbsd
*   openbsd
*   freebsd
*   android
*   illumos
*   solaris
*   plan9

#### system descriptor must be os/arch...what arches does it support?  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Identifying Supported Architectures**

I'm currently focusing on the supported architectures. I see the error message indicates a need for an `os/arch` format, and the user provided only 'linux'. My investigation has led me to the `detect.go` file, which seems critical in identifying which architectures are supported. I'll need to examine this further.


**Determining Acceptable Values**

I've now pinpointed the exact location of the error message; it originates in the `eget.go` file, specifically within the `getDetector` function. The crucial check validates the `--system` flag's format, ensuring it's provided as `os/arch`. I can now confirm the supported architectures are the keys of the `goarchmap`. My next step is to generate a response, incorporating both the supported architecture list and the correct format for the `--system` flag.


**Listing Supported Architectures**

I've reviewed the code and confirmed the supported architectures are extracted from the `goarchmap`. The list comprises `amd64`, `386`, `arm`, `arm64`, and `riscv64`. I'm ready to deliver the answer directly to the user, focusing solely on the requested list of architectures.


**Providing a Direct Response**

I've determined the supported architectures: `amd64`, `386`, `arm`, `arm64`, and `riscv64`. My response will be a concise list directly addressing the user's query.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Based on the `goarchmap` variable in `detect.go`, the supported architectures are:

*   amd64
*   386
*   arm
*   arm64
*   riscv64

#### when compiling for GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm i would like to avoid actual network calls since they are unsupported..instead translate these into fs reads from /tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Adapting Network Calls**

I'm currently refactoring the build process for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` to eliminate network dependencies. The central challenge is to intercept and redirect HTTP requests. I'm leaning towards mapping URLs like `http(s)://some/path` to local filesystem paths under `/tmp/some/path`. This approach should effectively replace network calls with local file operations.


**Examining Implementation Details**

I've reviewed `dl_wasip1.go` and noted its existing structure for handling the absence of network calls. My focus is now on how the `urlToPath` function transforms URLs into filesystem paths. I need to ensure the mapping of `http(s)://some/path` to `/tmp/some/path` is accurate and robust within this function. Also, I will investigate how to account for different HTTP methods.


**Evaluating URL Transformation**

I'm now analyzing the existing `urlToPath` function, which currently removes "http(s)://" prefixes. The prompt suggests a mapping to `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url`. I'm reconsidering the initial interpretation, which seemed to suggest removing the protocol entirely. It's more likely, given the prompt's wording, that I need to include "http" or "https" in the path structure, but I need to resolve the ambiguity.


**Clarifying Path Transformation**

I'm now wrestling with the path translation. The user's spec requires `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url`. Currently, the `urlToPath` function removes "http(s)://". I need to modify it to include the protocol. For example, I will need `https://foo/bar` to become `/tmp/https/foo/bar`. Also, I need to address URL encoding issues in filepaths, particularly dealing with query parameters like `?` characters. I will have to find a solution to this problem.


**Implementing Path Translation**

I'm now focusing on the `urlToPath` function's rewrite. I've decided to replace `://` with `/` in the URL. The plan is to use `strings.Replace` to convert `https://foo/bar` to `/tmp/https/foo/bar` as the initial step. Then, I'll use `path.Join` to construct the final filesystem path. I need to confirm the side-effects of this and find a robust way to handle the query parameters and other special characters.


**Parsing and Transforming URLs**

I'm now implementing a more robust `urlToPath` function. First, I'll parse the URL using `net/url`. Then, I will construct the path like `/tmp/https/host/path` and handle query parameters by replacing the `?` with `_`. This change aims to resolve the ambiguity around path construction and handle potential errors from the `url.Parse` function.


**Revising URL Transformation**

I'm re-evaluating the logic for handling the protocol prefix, as the user explicitly wants to incorporate "http" or "https" into the final path. The current approach strips them entirely. I need to modify the `urlToPath` function to include the protocol type in the directory structure, such as `/tmp/https/foo/bar` and address query parameters.


**Finalizing URL Path Translation**

I'm now refining the `urlToPath` function. My initial plan was to directly replace `://` with `/`, but I am still struggling to handle special characters and the query parameters in the URL. To handle these, I'm going to parse the URL using `net/url`. I'll then build the path as `/tmp/protocol/host/path`. Also, I will replace any `?` character to avoid any issues with the filesystem.


**Adjusting the Path Transformation**

I'm now aiming to make the simplest change that aligns with the user's specific instructions. The goal is to adapt `urlToPath` to create paths like `/tmp/https/rest/of/url`. I'll refactor the code and will replace `://` with `/`, and use `path.Join` to construct the filesystem path. This approach addresses the core requirement directly.


**Adjusting URL Transformation**

I'm now going to implement the user's instructions, which is a simple replacement in `urlToPath`. I'm going to replace `://` with `/` in the provided URL to modify the existing path. This will ensure that the protocol, such as "https", is included in the final filesystem path, such as `/tmp/https/rest/of/url`.


**Adjusting Implementation Details**

I'm now focusing on the existing `dl_wasip1.go` file, as instructed. I have identified the `urlToPath` function. My plan is to modify this function directly to meet the user's request for the `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url` structure. I am going to replace the function.


**Adjusting the Code**

I'm now implementing the required code transformation. My goal is to adjust the existing `urlToPath` function. I'm going to use `strings.Replace` to translate URLs to paths. The main goal is to include the protocol in the path, so `https://foo/bar` becomes `/tmp/https/foo/bar`. I also have to consider existing `GET` code.


**Adjusting the Code**

I'm now going to implement the change to the `urlToPath` function. My plan is to replace `://` with `/` and include the protocol in the path, like the user specified. This ensures that the protocol is included in the final path for WASM builds.


**Modifying Path Translation**

I'm now implementing the requested modification to the `urlToPath` function in `dl_wasip1.go`. I'm changing the code in `dl_wasip1.go` to translate URLs to file paths, specifically for the WASM builds. The function will convert URLs into the `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url` format. The current goal is to make this transformation, which includes correctly modifying `urlToPath` to produce the user's requested path.


**Implementing `urlToPath` Change**

I'm now focusing on the essential task of modifying the `urlToPath` function in the provided `dl_wasip1.go` file. My update is going to directly address the path format requested by the user, as specified by `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url`. The primary adjustment will be the inclusion of "http" or "https" in the path. I'm also confirming the correct file and functions.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. To handle `wasip1` builds, I will modify `dl_wasip1.go`. This file already contains logic to avoid network calls by reading from the filesystem.

I will update the `urlToPath` function to translate URLs into the format you requested: `/tmp/(http|https)/rest/of/url`. For example, `https://example.com/foo` will be mapped to the file path `/tmp/https/example.com/foo`.

Here is the change for `dl_wasip1.go`:

```go
dl_wasip1.go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func urlToPath(url string) string {
	p := strings.TrimPrefix(url, "https://")
	p = strings.TrimPrefix(p, "http://")
	return path.Join("/tmp", p)
}
=======
func urlToPath(url string) string {
	p := strings.Replace(url, "://", "/", 1)
	return path.Join("/tmp", p)
}

**Analyzing README Updates**

I've been reviewing the proposed changes to the `README.md` file. Specifically, I'm focusing on the new section detailing the WASI build of `eget`. I've confirmed it correctly highlights the local filesystem access and the lack of network I/O. I'm now evaluating the clarity of the usage instructions provided.


**Adjusting WASI Usage Examples**

I'm updating the provided bash history examples to reflect the `dl_wasip1.go` file's behavior. This includes correcting the URL paths to incorporate the `/tmp/` prefix and replacing the `://` with `/`. I'm ensuring the examples accurately demonstrate the filesystem interactions, and I'm simplifying the instructions to make them clearer and easier to follow.


**Constructing WASI Build Section**

I'm focusing on integrating a new section on the WASI build within the `README.md`. My current plan is to place it under the "How to get Eget" section as a subsection titled "WASI". I'm drafting the descriptive text, explaining the lack of network access, and the filesystem redirection to `/tmp/`. Finally, I am working on a corrected usage example derived from the provided bash history, to accurately demonstrate the WASI behavior.


**Crafting WASI Instructions**

I'm currently formulating the `README.md` section on the WASI build. I've decided on the "How to get Eget" subsection. I'm finalizing the text, emphasizing the filesystem access and lack of network calls, and explaining the path transformation. I'm now constructing a clear, correct, and executable example, using `curl -L` and directory creation commands.


**Refining the WASI Section**

I'm finalizing the text for the `### WASI` section, emphasizing the crucial aspects of the WASI build, including the filesystem redirection and lack of network calls. I'm currently formatting the corrected example, ensuring it accurately reflects the path transformation using the `curl` command with the `/tmp` prefix and correct directory creation. I will add it under "How to get Eget".


**Summarizing the WASI Section**

I've finished drafting the `### WASI` section of the `README.md`. I've shortened the explanation, clarifying filesystem redirection and emphasizing the lack of network calls, with an example using `curl -L` and `wasmtime`. I also emphasized the need to manually download and prepare assets inside `/tmp`. The example is also now shorter, using the user's initial bash history.


**Structuring the WASI Section**

I'm currently composing the `### WASI` section of the `README.md`. I've simplified the explanation of the WASI build, clarifying the lack of network access, and highlighting the filesystem redirection. I'm now crafting an example with concise bash commands using `mkdir`, `curl`, and `wasmtime`, to demonstrate the correct procedure for using `eget.wasm`.


**Finalizing README WASI Section**

I've added the completed `### WASI` section to the `README.md`. I have highlighted the lack of network calls and the filesystem redirection to `/tmp`, providing instructions and examples. I have included `curl` and `wasmtime` command usage, and made sure the instructions and example code are clear, concise, and executable for WASI build users.


**Summarizing the Example Section**

I'm now re-evaluating the example usage in the `### WASI` section. I have significantly shortened the explanation, focusing on the core aspects: the lack of network calls, and the filesystem redirection. I'm also creating a concise bash script for users to quickly test the `eget.wasm` binary.


**Adding the WASI Build Instructions**

I'm inserting the new `### WASI` section into the `README.md`. I have also significantly shortened the explanation, and added a complete working example, that the user can directly copy and paste, along with the necessary prerequisites. I have emphasized that the WASI build doesn't perform any network calls.


**Assembling the Final Example**

I'm refining the example provided within the `### WASI` section. I've shortened the bash commands, focusing on the core `mkdir`, `curl`, and `wasmtime` operations. I have ensured the example is concise and self-contained, allowing users to quickly test the WASI build of `eget`.


**Implementing the WASI Build**

I'm currently inserting the new `### WASI` section into the `README.md`, finalizing the examples and instructions, and ensuring clarity and brevity. I've kept the core message simple: no network calls, filesystem redirection, and how to use `eget.wasm` with `wasmtime`. I've also added a complete working example for easy use.


**Implementing the WASI Build**

I've completed the `### WASI` section in the `README.md`. I've also ensured the example uses `eget.wasm`, and is concise. I have highlighted the redirection to `/tmp`, and the lack of network calls, using clear commands and example code for the users to follow.


**Integrating the Final Instructions**

I've added the `### WASI` section, complete with an introductory explanation and a practical, executable example. The example uses `curl`, `wasmtime`, and demonstrates file preparation in `/tmp`, emphasizing the absence of network calls. I am now confident that these instructions are straightforward and sufficient for WASI users.


**Delivering the README Updates**

I've finished integrating the `### WASI` section into the `README.md`. I've kept the explanation concise, emphasizing the lack of network calls and the filesystem redirection. Also I've provided a working example using `curl`, `wasmtime`, and how to prepare the assets inside `/tmp`. I believe the new section is clear and ready.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. I will add a section to your `README.md` explaining how to use the WASI build of `eget`. This new section will describe how network requests are mapped to filesystem reads and will include corrected commands based on your bash history to demonstrate its usage.

Here is the change for `README.md`:

````markdown
README.md
<<<<<<< SEARCH
A man page can be generated by cloning the repository and running `make eget.1`
(requires pandoc). You can also use `eget` to download the man page: `eget -f eget.1 zyedidia/eget`.

# Usage
=======
A man page can be generated by cloning the repository and running `make eget.1`
(requires pandoc). You can also use `eget` to download the man page: `eget -f eget.1 zyedidia/eget`.

### WASI

A [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) compatible build is available on the [releases](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget/releases) page. This build of `eget` does not perform any network I/O. Instead, any network requests are translated into filesystem reads from `/tmp`. A request to `scheme://host/path` will be read from `/tmp/scheme/host/path`.

This is useful for running `eget` in sandboxed environments. You will need a WASI-compatible runtime like [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/).

To use the WASI build, you must manually provide the files `eget` would normally download. For example, to get `getsops/sops`:

First, fetch the release information from the GitHub API:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/https/api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases
curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases/latest > /tmp/https/api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases/latest
```

Then run `eget` with `wasmtime`. It will read the local file and tell you which asset to download.
```bash
wasmtime --dir=/ eget.wasm --system=linux/amd64 getsops/sops
```
After manually downloading the asset to the corresponding path under `/tmp`, run the command again to extract the binary.

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Revising Documentation**

I'm currently focused on updating the `README.md` file. It appears the documentation needs to be corrected to accurately reflect that the WASI build is built using the `build -wasi.sh` script, as it's not available in the releases. I'm preparing the necessary edits now.


**Correcting WASI Documentation**

I've identified the specific part of the `README.md` requiring modification. The initial statement about the WASI build's availability is inaccurate. My plan is to replace that with a statement referencing the `build-wasi.sh` script and explain the process of creating the WASI compatible binary, while also hinting at the lack of external network access. I'm also looking at the specifics of how to run the `build-wasi.sh` script.


**Analyzing the Script**

I've analyzed the `build-wasi.sh` script. It uses `go build` with `GOOS=wasip1` and `GOARCH=wasm`, confirming a WASM compilation. The output will likely be `eget.wasm`, but the script doesn't explicitly define an output. I've also checked the `go build` documentation to verify and the `.wasm` extension. My current approach is to update the documentation to reflect the use of the script and the likely output file. I'll also include the `wasmtime` command example.


**Updating the Documentation**

I'm refining the wording in the `README.md` now. I plan to replace the statement about WASI builds being available on the releases page. I will replace it with a note on how to create the `eget.wasm` file using the `./build-wasi.sh` script. The next step is to verify the file name, the `eget.wasm` will be produced by the build process.


**Modifying the Introduction**

I'm now ready to replace the existing introduction in the `README.md` file. I'll change the first sentence, which currently says WASI builds are on the releases page. My revised version will state that the WASI build is created by running the `build-wasi.sh` script. I've confirmed the output file name to be `eget.wasm`.


**Finalizing the Change**

I've completed the `README.md` edit, replacing the outdated sentence with instructions to create the WASI build using the `./build-wasi.sh` script. I've also verified the output file name to be `eget.wasm` and updated the description to reflect the lack of network I/O in the WASI build. My next step will be to verify the documentation changes on the build system.


**Finalizing Documentation Update**

I'm now preparing to replace the incorrect introduction in the `README.md`. The current text states that the WASI build is available on the releases page, which is inaccurate. Instead, I'll provide instructions to create the `eget.wasm` file using the `./build-wasi.sh` script. This change will accurately reflect the build process, while also indicating the lack of network I/O.

Of course. I will update the `README.md` to clarify that the WASI-compatible build is not available in the releases and must be built from source using the `build-wasi.sh` script.

Here is the change for `README.md`:

**Revising WASI Instructions**

I'm assessing the need to update the `README.md` file, specifically the WASI build instructions. It looks like the user wants to adjust these instructions to properly reflect how to generate `eget` of the wasm architecture. I am looking for the existing WASI build instructions.


**Analyzing README.md Edits**

I've identified the relevant section in `README.md` and confirmed the output file name discrepancy. The script builds `eget`, but the documentation incorrectly states `eget.wasm`. I've pinpointed the line that needs modification and am preparing to update the documentation to accurately reflect the build process.


**Verifying Output Name**

I've reviewed the build script again and confirmed the executable name is indeed `eget`. The user's instruction to change `eget.wasm` to `eget` is accurate. Consequently, I need to modify the example usage within the `README.md` file as well, updating it to reference `eget` instead of `eget.wasm` for consistency.


**Rephrasing Documentation Sentence**

I've focused on rewriting the sentence to reflect the correct output and its nature. Initially, I planned to change "This will produce an `eget.wasm` file" to  "This will produce an `eget` file (which is a WASM binary)." However, I am leaning towards "This will produce an `eget` binary for the `wasm` architecture" for clarity. Additionally, I am going to adjust the example usage command accordingly.


**Confirming WASM Architecture**

I've confirmed that the built `eget` binary is, in fact, for the `wasm` architecture, as the user indicated. The previous wording was inaccurate. Considering the context, and the user's request, I'm focusing on clarifying the build's output and adjusting the subsequent usage example to reflect the correct executable name. The documentation will need a more descriptive explanation.


**Adjusting Build Output Description**

I'm re-evaluating the best way to rephrase the documentation sentence. Considering the user's succinct request, and the need for clarity, I've decided on "This will produce an `eget` binary for the `wasm` architecture." I am also preparing to modify the subsequent usage example to reflect this change.


**Simplifying Build Output Description**

I'm considering whether to just change "This will produce an `eget.wasm` file" to "This will produce an `eget` file." The context implies a WASM binary, making a more verbose description potentially unnecessary. However, the user's request includes "(of wasm arch)", so I am going to include that information for clarity. I am deciding between a few ways to phrase it.


**Clarifying Architecture Output**

I'm now revising the description again, drawing from the user's instruction to produce `eget (of wasm arch)`. Therefore, I've decided to change the wording to "This will produce an `eget` binary for the `wasm` architecture." This change directly addresses the file naming issue and clarifies the binary's target architecture.


**Evaluating Simplest Change**

I'm considering the most straightforward update: changing "This will produce an `eget.wasm` file" to "This will produce `eget` (of wasm arch)". However, this phrasing feels somewhat incomplete, and I'm working on improving its flow within the existing documentation's style and clarity.


**Finalizing Output Description**

I've decided on a final description change to "This will produce an `eget` binary for the `wasm` architecture," aligning with the user's concise request. This revision ensures both clarity and accuracy, highlighting the correct file name and its target architecture. Now I need to adjust the example command to match.

#### modify build script to have -o eget.wasm  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Modifying the Script**

I'm currently focusing on modifying the `build-wasi.sh` script. The goal is to add the `-o eget.wasm` flag to the `go build` command, so that the output will be named `eget.wasm`. I have reviewed the script's current state and now I'm implementing the change.


**Confirming the Changes**

I've confirmed that the `build-wasi.sh` script modification aligns with the user's instructions. The script will now explicitly name the output file `eget.wasm`. This aligns with the user's request and the documentation, which already reflects this output. I'm satisfied with this update.


**Analyzing README.md**

I've re-examined the `README.md` file. It clearly documents that the `build-wasi.sh` script creates `eget.wasm`, which aligns perfectly with the planned modification. This confirms my understanding of the project and the user's requirements. Next, I will implement the change.


**Refining the Approach**

I've analyzed the discrepancy between the script's output and the README.md. The change to `build-wasi.sh` is now clear; it correctly addresses this, producing `eget.wasm`. I'm ready to implement the modification to `build-wasi.sh`. After that, I plan to suggest running the updated build script to confirm the results.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. I will modify `build-wasi.sh` to explicitly name the output file `eget.wasm`. This will make the script's behavior consistent with the instructions in `README.md`.

Here is the change for `build-wasi.sh`:

````sh
build-wasi.sh
<<<<<<< SEARCH
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath
=======
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -o eget.wasm -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

You can run the updated script to build the WASI binary:

```bash
./build-wasi.sh
```

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Reviewing Edit Instructions**

I'm currently focused on the specific edits required for `README.md`. I've pinpointed the need to reposition the WASI section, moving it higher up within the "How to get Eget" segment. Furthermore, I've recognized the necessity to update the section title, renaming "WASI" to "WASI/WASM".


**Confirming File Modifications**

I've now reviewed the `README.md` content, and verified the structure of the "How to get Eget" section. I have confirmed the "WASI" subsection's existing placement and the exact content. I'm now confident in the actions needed: to relocate the entire WASI block to the top and rename the section header, which will involve a delete and insert operation.


**Planning Deletion and Insertion**

I've now determined the precise markdown to be moved, which encompasses the "WASI" section. I am preparing to execute the deletion of this section. Following that, I will formulate the precise insertion point at the top of the "How to get Eget" section. Simultaneously, I'm preparing the exact code needed to rename the section.


**Determining Section Boundaries**

I've now accurately pinpointed the start and end points of the "WASI" section within `README.md`. The content to be extracted begins with the `### WASI` header and concludes before the `# Usage` section. I now can formulate the necessary deletion and insertion operations with complete accuracy.


**Isolating Target Sections**

I've now finalized the identification of the exact text block to be excised, spanning from the `### WASI` header down to the concluding line of the WASI section, right before the `# Usage` header. The "From source" section's tail, including the man page instructions, will remain. I'm ready to proceed with deleting the WASI content.


**Formulating Action Plan**

I've now fully grasped the overall strategy. I'll first excise the WASI section, including the `### WASI` header, then insert it under `<h1>How to get Eget</h1>`, renaming the header to `### WASI/WASM`. All prior steps are complete, and now the focus is on execution.


**Finalizing Code Modification**

I've now determined the exact markdown snippets for both the deletion and insertion operations within `README.md`. I will remove the "WASI" section and place it directly after the introductory sentence of the "How to get Eget" section, updating the header to "WASI/WASM". All steps have been completed; I am ready to proceed with the edits.


**Refining Edit Implementation**

I've now analyzed the `README.md` content to determine the best approach for applying the changes. The deletion and insertion operations will be executed using precise markdown blocks, ensuring seamless integration. My next step is to enact the changes.


**Validating Final Edits**

I've now analyzed the `README.md` to ensure my changes will be accurate. The plan involves removing the WASI section, which is followed by inserting it at a new position and modifying the header. I'm ready to finalize the operations.


**Implementing Text Replacement**

I've now formulated the necessary code alterations and analyzed the surrounding context. The core strategy involves deleting the WASI section and then inserting the modified section with the new title. I am now preparing for the actual implementation of these edits.


**Verifying Code Execution**

I've now meticulously prepared the necessary text replacements for `README.md`. I'm ready to execute these modifications, which include deleting the WASI section from its original location and inserting the section, with its renamed header, at the top of the "How to get Eget" section. I will proceed to run the changes.


**Implementing Section Movement**

I've completed the core task of formulating the necessary edits to `README.md`. This involves deleting the WASI section from its current location, then inserting it within the "How to get Eget" section, while updating the header to "WASI/WASM". I'm ready to present the final changes.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. I will move the "WASI" section to the top of the "How to get Eget" section in your `README.md` and rename its heading to "WASI/WASM".

# How to get Eget

Before you can get anything, you have to get Eget. If you already have Eget and want to upgrade, use `eget zyedidia/eget`.

### WASI/WASM

A [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) compatible build can be created by running the `./build-wasi.sh` script. This will produce an `eget.wasm` file. This build of `eget` does not perform any network I/O. Instead, any network requests are translated into filesystem reads from `/tmp`. A request to `scheme://host/path` will be read from `/tmp/scheme/host/path`.

This is useful for running `eget` in sandboxed environments. You will need a WASI-compatible runtime like [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/).

To use the WASI build, you must manually provide the files `eget` would normally download. For example, to get `getsops/sops`:

First, fetch the release information from the GitHub API:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/https/api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases
curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases/latest > /tmp/https/api.github.com/repos/getsops/sops/releases/latest
```

Then run `eget` with `wasmtime`. It will read the local file and tell you which asset to download.
```bash
wasmtime --dir=/ eget.wasm --system=linux/amd64 getsops/sops
```
After manually downloading the asset to the corresponding path under `/tmp`, run the command again to extract the binary.
