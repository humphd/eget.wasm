<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Defining the Scope**

I've clarified the user's request. It's a system administration issue, not a coding problem. Therefore, I'll focus on providing upgrade instructions for Go and avoid suggesting code modifications or requesting files. The core task is now well-defined.


**Prioritizing the Answer**

I've focused on the most direct approach. My goal is to deliver a clear, concise guide to the user. I will provide the essential steps for upgrading the Go installation, starting with downloading the latest binary. The plan is to cover the removal of the old version, extracting the new archive, and finally, verifying the path.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

It looks like you're asking for instructions on how to upgrade your Go installation, which is a system-level change rather than a change to the code in your repository.

To upgrade Go to the latest version, you would typically follow these general steps:

1.  **Download the latest Go version:** Go to the official Go downloads page (golang.org/dl/) and download the appropriate archive for your operating system (Linux x86-64 in your case).
2.  **Remove the old installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    ```
3.  **Install the new version:** Extract the archive you downloaded into `/usr/local`. If you downloaded `go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz` (replace `1.XX.Y` with the actual version), you would run:
    ```bash
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.XX.Y.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
4.  **Update your PATH (if necessary):** Ensure that `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable. You might need to update your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) by adding or modifying a line like:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    ```
    Then, source the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or open a new terminal.

After these steps, you can verify the new installation:
```bash
go version
```

Please note that these are general instructions. You should always refer to the official Go installation documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Since this isn't a code change request for your project, I won't suggest any file edits.

#### GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build builds a huge binary, what  flags to use to optimize for footprint  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Examining Build Optimization**

I'm currently analyzing the user's request for optimized Go build flags for WebAssembly compilation (GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm). I am focusing on providing the most concise and effective `go build` command, specifically targeting reduced binary size, without changing any Go source code. I will present the solution in a `bash` block, as requested.


**Crafting the Build Command**

I've finalized the `go build` command, integrating the essential flags for size optimization. The command will include `-ldflags="-s -w"` for stripping debug information and symbol tables, along with `-trimpath` to further reduce the binary footprint. I will now verify the command's syntax to make sure it works as expected.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

To optimize for a smaller binary footprint when building for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm`, you can use the `-ldflags` option with `-s` and `-w`. The `-s` flag omits the symbol table and debug information, and the `-w` flag omits the DWARF symbol table. Additionally, `-trimpath` can help by removing local file system paths from the compiled binary.

Here's a suggested command:

```bash
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o yourprogram.wasm .
```
Replace `yourprogram.wasm` with your desired output file name and `.` with the path to your main package if it's not the current directory.

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

**Examining Conditional Compilation**

I'm currently focused on how to implement conditional compilation to avoid network calls for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds. The strategy is to redirect network requests to file system reads from `/tmp` and `/url`. I've started sketching out the build tag implementation to differentiate the `wasip1` build.


**Defining Filesystem Reads**

I've started examining the `dl.go` file to identify network-related functions. Specifically, I need to replace `Get`, `SetAuthHeader` and functions that are dependent on these with filesystem-based alternatives. I've decided to create a `dl_wasip1.go` with a build tag for the `wasip1` target to implement these file system alternatives.


**Planning Filesystem Mappings**

My current focus is on how to map URLs to filesystem paths. For `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds, I need to transform URLs like `https://api.github.com/repos/foo/bar/releases?page=1` into filesystem paths. I think I'll replace `https://` with an empty string to create the filepath. Now I am exploring how to handle any existing query parameters in a clean way.


**Designing URL to Path Mapping**

I'm currently evaluating the most practical method for translating URLs into filesystem paths. Replacing "https://" with "" simplifies the path structure, but the remaining slashes pose a challenge. The `/tmp/url` directory suggested by the user is guiding my implementation.


**Mapping URL and Files**

I'm now focusing on the `Get` function, and how to implement the filesystem read within it. The primary goal is to transform the URL into a usable file path under `/tmp`. My plan is to replace "https://" with an empty string and use the `path.Join` function to build a path. I'll then create a stub `Get` in `dl_wasip1.go` that handles opening the file, returning a plausible `http.Response` with the file content.


**Refactoring GetRateLimit**

I've been making progress on replacing the `GetRateLimit` function. I've decided to read from a file in `/tmp`, and unmarshal the JSON content directly to satisfy the wasm build requirement. I'm also evaluating whether to modify the existing `IsLocalFile` function or create a new one to handle the URL-to-path translation.


**Evaluating Wasip1 Implementation**

I'm currently planning the implementation of `GetRateLimit` and how it interacts with the new `Get` function. The goal is to ensure that `GetRateLimit` reads the rate limit data from the file system in the wasm build. I need to determine the best way to handle the file system path for this function.


**Defining dl_nowasm.go and dl_wasip1.go**

I'm changing course and planning to use `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, with build tags. The `dl_nowasm.go` file will contain the original implementations, and will use the `//go:build !wasip1` build tag.  The `dl_wasip1.go` file will contain my wasm implementations. This avoids duplicating type definitions, and simplifies build tag management.


**Structuring the Code**

I'm now refactoring the code to use `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go`, with build tags to manage different implementations. This includes moving common type definitions to avoid duplication. This approach simplifies the conditional compilation for network operations.


**Structuring The Files**

I'm now working on separating the code into `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, as well as a `dl_common.go` for shared types, like `RateLimit`. This involves moving the common definitions and planning build tags for conditional compilation of the network and filesystem implementations.


**Restructuring and Code Splitting**

I've shifted my focus to structuring the code for the wasm implementation. My plan is to create `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files, each with build tags. This is for code clarity and maintainability.


**Implementing dl_common.go**

I've decided to introduce a `dl_common.go` file to hold the shared types, namely `RateLimitJson` and `RateLimit`, and their associated methods. This refactoring will allow me to avoid duplicating these definitions in both the `dl_nowasm.go` and `dl_wasip1.go` files.


**Implementing Shared Definitions**

I'm now focused on building the `dl_common.go` file and defining the `RateLimitJson`, and `RateLimit` structs within it. These structs will be shared, eliminating any redundancy in the other two files. This approach also means I will keep using the `Download` function from the non-wasm implementation.


**Splitting the Files**

I'm now focused on creating and organizing the necessary files for the wasm build. My plan is to split the code into three files: `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. This separation will help with conditional compilation and code clarity by separating http and wasm implementations.


**Refactoring File Structure**

I'm now restructuring the code with three files: `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. The common types will live in `dl_common.go` to avoid duplication. I'll place `dl.go` in the original location and add the appropriate build tags.


**Creating Build Tag Structure**

I'm now refactoring the files and plan to create `dl_http.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go`. This is for clarity and to separate the http and wasm implementations. The `dl_common.go` file will house shared definitions to avoid duplication across the other two files.


**Defining File Splits**

I'm now planning the required file structure with `dl.go` handling HTTP, and `dl_wasip1.go` providing the wasm implementation, and `dl_common.go` for shared data structures. This approach will address the need to avoid network calls during wasm compilation.


**Adapting for wasm Build**

I've recently decided to introduce `dl_nowasm.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and `dl_common.go` files to restructure the codebase for better clarity. This design will allow me to keep the current network calls while separately implementing the filesystem reads for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm` builds.


**Refining the File Split**

I'm now making the final modifications to the `dl_wasip1.go` file, including a more robust URL-to-path conversion within the `urlToPath` function to handle both `http` and `https` prefixes. Also, I'm confirming that both files have all necessary function definitions and that the `Download` function will seamlessly integrate the filesystem reads.


**Creating wasm implementation**

I'm now focused on creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file, which will contain all of the wasm-specific logic. This file will include the same exported functions as `dl.go` but with implementations that use the filesystem.


**Adapting to wasm Implementation**

I'm wrapping up the creation of the `dl_wasip1.go` file, concentrating on how to handle the `urlToPath` function, which has undergone a refinement for both `http` and `https` URL prefixes. Also, I'm currently verifying that all the required function definitions are correctly implemented within the `dl_wasip1.go` file and that the `Download` function can integrate these file system read operations as needed.


**Finalizing Wasm Implementation**

I'm now putting the finishing touches on the `dl_wasip1.go` file. This involves refining the `urlToPath` function, which now handles both `http` and `https` prefixes. I'm also verifying that the wasm implementation for `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and other methods are correctly implemented and the `Download` function correctly utilizes the filesystem implementation.


**Adapting for Filesystem Reads**

I'm currently working on implementing the `dl_wasip1.go` file, containing all of the wasm-specific logic. The main focus is on correctly mapping the URLs, including both `http` and `https` prefixes, to paths that can be read from the filesystem, using a newly defined `urlToPath` function.


**Creating wasm Implementations**

I'm currently adding the `//go:build !wasip1` build tag to `dl.go` and then creating `dl_wasip1.go`. This will separate the network and filesystem implementations. I'm still assessing the most effective approach to handle the common functions and structs, like `Download` and `RateLimitJson`.


**Adapting to Wasm Implementation**

I'm starting to focus on the main file's content for wasm builds. I'll be adding `dl_wasip1.go` and `dl_common.go` files, creating a clear separation of concerns. The goal is to adapt the implementation to use filesystem operations, while maintaining the original `dl.go` file.


**Implementing Wasm Build**

I'm now focusing on the most efficient way to handle the wasm implementation, given the constraint to avoid any network calls. The plan involves adding `//go:build !wasip1` to `dl.go` and creating `dl_wasip1.go` with `//go:build wasip1` to implement the filesystem-based alternatives, including the `urlToPath` function.


**Implementing wasm build tags**

I'm now completing the code splitting, adding the `//go:build !wasip1` tag to the original file and creating a new `dl_wasip1.go` to contain the wasm implementation. This approach should keep the original implementation untouched while ensuring the wasm build utilizes filesystem operations.


**Refactoring for Build Tags**

I'm currently planning to restructure the code using the `dl.go`, `dl_wasip1.go`, and potentially a `dl_common.go`. The primary focus is now on separating the HTTP and wasm implementations using build tags, with `dl_common.go` to contain common types. I'm also considering whether I need to refactor the `Download` function.


**Implementing wasm build**

I'm now creating `dl_wasip1.go` for wasm-specific functions, as I planned. This file will contain all the same public functions as the original `dl.go`, but it will use filesystem reads instead of network calls for  `Get`, `GetRateLimit` and `Download`.


**Implementing wasm build**

I'm now implementing the wasm build by adding `//go:build !wasip1` to the original `dl.go` file, and by creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file to contain the filesystem-based implementations of `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and `Download`. This ensures that the wasm build targets use file system reads to avoid network calls.


**Implementing wasm builds**

I'm now implementing the wasm build by adding `//go:build !wasip1` to the original `dl.go` file, and by creating the `dl_wasip1.go` file to contain the filesystem-based implementations of `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and `Download`. This ensures that the wasm build targets use file system reads to avoid network calls.


**Implementing wasip1 builds**

I'm now submitting the required updates. I'll add the build tag `//go:build !wasip1` to the `dl.go` file, making it exclusive to non-wasm builds. Then, I'll create a new file, `dl_wasip1.go`, containing the `wasip1` build with filesystem-based implementations for `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and related functions, to satisfy the user's need.


**Finalizing Build Implementation**

I've now completed the file adaptations by adding the build tag `//go:build !wasip1` to `dl.go`, ensuring that the file excludes the wasip1 builds. Also, I've created `dl_wasip1.go`, which contains the filesystem-based functions, including `Get`, `GetRateLimit`, and the necessary helper functions and data structures.




</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Of course. To avoid network calls when compiling for `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm`, I will use build tags to provide an alternative implementation of the functions in `dl.go`.

Here is my plan:
1.  I will add a `//go:build !wasip1` build tag to `dl.go`. This will exclude the file from compilation when targeting `wasip1`.
2.  I will create a new file, `dl_wasip1.go`, with a `//go:build wasip1` build tag. This file will provide implementations for the functions in `dl.go` that read from the filesystem instead of making network calls, as you requested. For a given URL, it will attempt to read from `/tmp/` plus the URL's path.

**Crafting a Build Script**

I'm now focused on implementing the user's request. The plan is straightforward: I need to generate a new file, specifically `build-wasi.sh`. Inside this file, the script will execute the `go build` command, targeting the WASI platform. I'm paying attention to setting the correct environment variables for the target platform as well. The build is being optimized to reduce the final binary size.


**Defining the Shell Script**

I've finalized the contents of `build-wasi.sh`.  I'm confident that the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables are correctly set. The `-ldflags` and `-trimpath` flags are also set appropriately for optimal binary size. I'm preparing the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block for the new file, including `#!/bin/sh` for proper execution. The script should be fully functional now. I will next implement the shell command.


**Finalizing File and Command**

I've refined the script, and now I am ready to move onto the final steps. I'm using a `SEARCH/REPLACE` block, and I'm including the necessary `#!/bin/sh` shebang. The provided shell command to execute will address the executability of the file, as requested. I will also provide an explanation to make my intentions clear.

Of course. I will create the `build-wasi.sh` script as you requested.

Here is the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block to create the file:

```sh
build-wasi.sh
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
#!/bin/sh
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And here is the command to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x build-wasi.sh
```
